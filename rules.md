# 1 Dash Incubator

[Dash Incubator](https://dashincubator.app/) is an open-source, blockchain funded Application that redistributes [Dash](https://www.dash.org/) issued from [Superblocks](https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/governance/understanding.html) to users who produce open-source output that forwards our [Strategy](#13-strategy) in support of our [Dash Vision](#12-dash-vision).

The Incubator uses its own micro-incentive based [Bounty](#2-bounties) system to fund and manage the end-to-end delivery of a wide variety of projects [proposed](#21-concepts) by the community, ranging from small [jobs](#22-bounty-types) such as bug bounties, to ongoing [services](#22-bounty-types) such as promotions or infrastructure provision, to mid-size development [projects](#22-bounty-types) such as dApps and development tools, to large development [programmes](#22-bounty-types) involving multiple products that need to be developed and launched together.

Fund allocation and management is decentralized across [Admin](#4-admins) users who are [incentivized](#44-admin-rewards) with a percentage of the Dash they award on Bounties and a Governance Committee responsible for fund management.

The Incubator is classified as an [open-source Dash Funded Organization (DFO)](#14-full-transparency), meaning that all internal operations of the Incubator are conducted in the public domain at all times.  This includes how work is proposed, selected, specified, developed, tested, approved, which users are completing or managing work, what rewards they are allocating or receiving and all internal decision making and governance.

All work produced by the Incubator, known as Output, including the Incubator App software itself, is open-source and licensed under MIT License.

All handling and allocation of Incubator [funds](#5-funds) can be publicly verified down to [user-task](#25-tasks) level via the [Dash Blockchain](#54-auditing) in realtime. 

## 1.1 Mission

Our mission is to find, support and fund the most promising developers and entrepreneurs to build and grow the most innovative and user-friendly applications that maximize the usecases and utility of Dash.

## 1.2 Dash Vision

Our vision is to grow Dash to become the number one cryptocurrency for everyday payments by constantly innovating the fastest, easiest-to-use and most cost-effective digital cash at global scale.

## 1.3 Strategy

The Incubator's Strategy is defined as the set of [criteria](131-funding-criteria) that defines the types of [Bounties](#2-bounties) that [Admins](#4-admins) can fund, coupled to a [Roadmap](#132-roadmap) that defines priorities that Admins use to allocate and prioritize resources across Bounties, to ensure that resources are focused effectively in support of our [Mission](#11-mission) and [Dash Vision](#12-dash-vision).

## 1.3.1 Funding Criteria

[Admins](#4-admins) may fund [Bounties](#2-bounties) that meet the following criteria:

1. Funding or kickstarting the development of dApps on Dash Platform that grow Dash's online and Web 3 usecases, ease-of-use and utility.
2. Funding the dApps that are focused on P2P commerce, E-commerce, Retail, Payments, remittance, or any kind of monetization or tokenization that increases the economic usage of Dash as a priority.
3. Funding the development and provision of tools and resources that aid developers, users and providers of Dash Platform.
4. Funding development that improves onboarding for Dash users.
5. Funding development that improves and sustains the Incubator itself.
6. Funding Protocol development to support and implement the Incubator's Strategy when needed.
7. Funding promotion of Dash Platform related features and dApps to developers and end-users.
8. Funding development in other DFOs with synergistic Strategies where doing so will expedite, support or unblock resources or products upon which our Mission depends.
9. Kickstarting initiatives that help to support and retain developers who are key to the Dash project in general.
10. Kickstarting Incubator forks with synergistic Strategies to increase competition and decentralization within the DFO ecosystem.

Bounties that don't meet any of these criteria won't be funded by the Incubator.

> The term Kickstarting is used in the Incubator to mean the funding of Bounties that initiate projects but include a plan to hand them off to 3rd parties to fund and monetize their longer-term development, including potentially raising individual Proposals to accomplish that. 

## 1.3.2 Roadmap

Our Roadmap is the list of priorities by which we allocate resources between [Bounties](#2-bounties) and is stated in the most recent [Proposal](#64-proposals).  


## 1.4 Full-Transparency

To ensure that the Incubator's processes and information remain fully open-source and encourage the same standard for other DFOs in Dash, we introduce the following criteria for an **Open-Source DFO** classification that the Incubator implements:

1. All funding receipts and expenditure are tracked
2. All work systems and their data are public
3. All work preparation and pricing is public
4. All work output is public
5. All people's work and rewards are public and verifiable
6. All rules governing the Incubator and decisions on how to maintain those rules are public

The only exception would be user credentials, i.e. their login passwords (which won't be needed when the Incubator App moves onto Dash Platform)

## 1.5 Users

There are several levels to classification of Incubator App users as follows:

- Users - anyone who accesses the Incubator App or its underlying data
- Members - any user who has signed up to create an account on the App
- [Contributors](#3-contributing) - Members who create output for the Incubator
- [Admins](#4-admins) - Members with rights to create and manage Bounties, and earn commission from Task rewards
- [Governance Committee](#53-governance-committee) - Admins who are designated to manage funds, for voting and to contribute towards raising Proposals to the Dash network on behalf of the Incubator 

> Currently all Members can be found as the members of our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/FPJzDcok/dash-incubator-app)

## 1.6 Network Contract

This document contains the Rules that define the terms between [Dash Incubator](#1-dash-incubator) and the [Dash Network](https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/governance/understanding.html#) for how any funding awarded to the Incubator by the Network will be used.

When coupled with Incubator's [full transparency](#14-full-transparency) policy, anyone can trustlessly audit how well the Incubator is meeting the commitments of these terms in realtime, including verifying the use of all funding via the Dash blockchain itself down to a user/task level.

We refer to the transparent implementation of the terms defined in this document in return for the funding provided from Dash Network as the Network Contract.

The Incubator is required to abide by the Network Contract at all times.

The authoritative source for the Rules are contained in a single document hosted on [Github](https://github.com/DashIncubator/dash-incubator-rules/blob/master/rules.md), with updates to the Rules (enacted as merged commits to the master branch) taking effect immediately.

## 1.7 Legal

The Incubator is an open-source application and not a legal entity and as such doesnâ€™t own any assets, including any rights to any output, nor does the Incubator apply any restrictions on contributor's usage of their own Task output, apart from the requirement that all output must be open-sourced under MIT license.

The only funding the Incubator App receives is in the form of Dash tokens issued directly from the Dash blockchain, which it redistributes to users who provide verifiable open-source output for predefined tasks approved by Admins, who agree to operate in accordance with the Rules defined in this document.

The Incubator does not handle, hold or pay fiat currency and all rewards are issued in Dash tokens as incentives for creating some open-source output, at the sole discretion of Incubator Admins, and without any agreement or action to purchase or procure any assets, intellectual property or labor.

# 2 Bounties

A Bounty in the Incubator means a collection of work that can be completed by contributors for a reward, such as development or promotion of Dash or of the Incubator itself.

Bounties are first proposed as Concepts by the community, and there are four [types](#22-bounty-types) of Bounty that can be funded, each containing a series of [Tasks](#22-bounty-types) that are managed by the Bounty's [Admin](#4-admins), who earn a % commission of all rewards that the Bounty generates.

## 2.1 Concepts

All Bounties start as a Concept that is [proposed](#31-proposing-concepts) to the Incubator by a community member.

Concepts are proposals for some work that the Incubator should fund as a Bounty, that provide enough detail about the value proposition and requirements of the work to enable Contributors to complete it.

[Admins](#4-admins) create a Bounty for each Concept they Accept that they then Own, meaning they have the rights to manage and earn commission from its delivery.

Admins can [Accept](#435-processing-task-claims) any Concept that meets our [Concept Acceptance Criteria](#411-concept-acceptance-criteria) on a first-come first-serve basis.

Once accepted, the user who created the Concept is automatically assigned as a [Stakeholder](#25-bounty-stakeholders) of the corresponding bounty.

## 2.2 Bounty Types

When a Bounty is created from a [Concept](#21-concepts) by an [Admins](#4-admins), they assign one of four types for the new Bounty that determine how work will be structured:

- **Projects** develop products such as a decentralized app built on Dash (dApps), tools for the community or improvements to the Dash Protocol itself.
- **Services** provide ongoing work that involves provision of some service, such as website hosting, code maintenance, or a recurring requirement for servicing the Incubator itself.
- **Jobs** are one-off pieces of work, such as finding bugs or fixing a github issue.
- **Programmes** are collections of Project, Service or Job Bounties that coordinate large pieces of work.

> All Bounties in the Incubator are represented by a Card on our [Trello Board](#https://trello.com/b/FPJzDcok/dash-incubator-app). The Bounty's type is represented by the column the Card is in on the Board.  Meta Bounties are shown with the pink label on the Card's front cover.

## 2.3 Bounty Status

Each Bounty can be set to have one of the following Statuses at any time:

- **Active** - The Bounty is in progress any Tasks can be created, edited or completed
- **Paused** - The Bounty is on-hold and no Tasks can be created, edited or completed
- **Completed** - The Bounty is archived and no changes can be made.

## 2.4 Bounty Stakeholders

For some bounties, Admins may wish to regularly solicit the views of subject area experts or other key stakeholders as part of the decision making process when defining bounty tasks. 

Whilst bounty administration remains under the Admins of the bounty, a record of these Stakeholders, the nature of their interest, and the circumstances under which they should be consulted, may be added to the Bounty data.

[Concept](#21-concepts) creators are automatically added as Stakeholders of any Bounty that derives from the Concept.

> On Trello, the stakeholder usernames are added to the Card's description in a Stakeholders section by the primary or secondary Admin, including any additional information on the context for their involvement.

## 2.5 Tasks

A Task is the basic unit-of-work in the Incubator and represents a unit of open-source output that a user can produce for a specified reward.

All work in the Incubator, and consequently any use of funds, is performed via completion of a Task by a user, or the management of that Task by an [Admin](#4-admins), within a specific Bounty.

Tasks are defined by Admins and can be completed by any user after [reserving](#33-reserving-tasks) the tasks with the Admin, or in the case of [Job](#22-bounty-types) tasks, completed without reservation.

Each Task must define some quantifiable Output (a document, commit, etc) that a user can produce to be eligible to [Claim](#26-claims) the specified reward.

There are four types of Task available within the Incubator:

- [Concept Tasks](#251-concept-tasks) - the initial creation of a Concept that results in the creation of a new Bounty
- [Specification Tasks](#252-specification-tasks) - work that provides the detail necessary to define Production Tasks
- [Production Tasks](#253-production-tasks) - work related to Tasks required to complete Project, Service and Job bounties
- [QA Tasks](#254-qa-tasks) - work that assures the quality of Production Tasks

> Each Task Type is represented as a named Checklist on the Bountyâ€™s Trello Card, except for Concept Tasks, which are implicitly completed when a Concept is Accepted by an Admin.

### 2.5.1 Concept Tasks

A Concept Task is defined as the [submission of new Concept](#31-proposing-concepts) by an Incubator user.

The [Claim](#34-claiming-tasks) for a Concept Reward is considered to be implicit and approved as soon as an Admin [Accepts](#41-accepting-concepts) the Concept.

Note that several Bounties can be [forked](#424-forking-bounties) from a single Concept, however, the Concept reward is only paid the first time the Concept is accepted.

### 2.5.2 Specification Tasks

Specification Tasks define how [Production Tasks](#253-production-tasks) should be completed and [QA'd](#254-qa-tasks).

The output is usually a document such as a Design Requirements doc, Functional Specification, or any resource that enables output relating to achieving the Value Proposition of the Bounty to be produced effectively.

Admins measure the quality of the Specification in terms of its fitness for purpose and adequate detail level to define the Production Tasks a [Contributor](#15-users) needs to implement it.

### 2.5.3 Production Tasks

Production Tasks are the actual output of a Bounty that deliver the value proposition. 

Usually Production Tasks output some code or a working product, but if the Bounty is for example a research project, the Production Tasks could output documents or analysis, or any format that satisfies the goals of the Bounty.

### 2.5.4 QA Tasks

Quality Assurance tasks validate and test that [Production Tasks](#253-production-tasks) meet their [Specification](#252-specification-tasks).

Most Production Tasks should require related QA tasks, and Specifications should include a QA plan to provide a clear and easy way to measure how well a Production Task meets its spec when the QA is performed.

QA Tasks must reference the relevant Specification or Production Task and produce some QA report output.

> It is recommended to use the [QA Report Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FCIPJTGGNe-bmjEadO1QtJIvNI5L93Dgv0UeJ6lJzaM/edit) unless the admin requests an alternative format.

## 2.6 Claims

A Claim is the process of a user signalling that they have completed a [Task](#25-tasks) and wish to receive the Task's stated reward.

Users can create Claims for Tasks they believe to be complete from the [Admin](#4-admins) who owns the Task using the [Claims process](#34-claiming-tasks).

Once a Task Claim is approved by an Admin, the Task Reward will be awarded to the Dash address the claimant specified in the Claim within 7 days.

## 2.7 Rewards

Incubator is a pure-Dash fund meaning all rewards are awarded in Dash.

Each type of [Task](#25-tasks) offered by the Incubator has limits on the min/max rewards an Admin may [price](#433-pricing-tasks) as defined below. Task limit exceptions can be agreed by the Governance Committee on a case-by-case basis. In the event an Admin needs to exceed the task limit, they should submit a request to the Governance Committee with adequate background/justification and (once/if the vote passes) add a comment to the Bountyâ€™s Trello Card specifying the reason and the vote outcome.

The Admin % is an added [commission reward](#44-admin-rewards) that an Admin earns for Approving a Claim on a Task they own, plus a [commission bonus](#441-commission-bonuses) based on the Admin's level of activity.

# 3 Contributing

Contributing to the Incubator involves completing [Tasks](#25-tasks) on [Bounties](#2-bounties) to earn [Rewards](#27-rewards).

A reward can also be earned by proposing a Concept for new Bounties that get accepted by an [Admin](#4-admins).

All work produced at the Incubator must be open-sourced under MIT license before any rewards can be paid, to satisfy the Incubator's [full-transparency](#14-full-transparency) requirements.

## 3.1 Proposing Concepts

Anyone can create a [Concept](#21-concepts) by signing up to the Incubator and submitting a [New Concept Template](https://trello.com/c/6XAuy9DW/94-request-new-concept).

Any [Admin](#4-admins) can [Accept](#435-processing-task-claims) a Concept that meets our [Concept Acceptance Criteria](#411-concept-acceptance-criteria), meaning they create a new [Bounty](#2-bounties) for it that they become the owner of.

The [Concept Reward](#271-price-list) is paid to the Dash address listed in the Concept if and when it is accepted by any of the Admins.

>- To propose a Concept, add a comment on the [New Concept Card](https://trello.com/c/6XAuy9DW/94-request-new-concept) on Trello.  
>- To chat with Admins about a Concept or its acceptance, join the [DashDevs Discord](https://discord.gg/mU79ZWx) and ask on the #dash-incubator channel.

## 3.2 Completing Job Tasks

Job Tasks on Bounties are open to be claimed by anyone without needing to reserve the task.

To claim a reward on a Job task, use the [Claims process](#34-claiming-tasks)

## 3.3 Reserving Tasks

Any tasks other than Jobs can be reserved.  This means that you can agree with the Task's Admin to have exclusive rights to claim the Task until the due date.  

To reserve a task, leave a comment for the Admin of the Bounty that the Task is a part of, so that they can assign the task to you, and/or discuss the Task details and negotiate the reward.

Once you have completed the Task, use the [Claims process](#34-claiming-tasks) to claim the reward.

If a claim isn't made by the due date, the Admin can extend the date, or has the option to cancel the reservation.

> To be able to Reserve a Task please join as a Member of our Trello Board by leaving a comment on our [Member Signup Card](https://trello.com/c/VlpK4dgl/95-member-signup).

## 3.4 Claiming Tasks

Once you have completed the work for a Task you can make a [Claim](#26-claims) for the reward on the Task, by providing the following information:

1. Link to the source for the tasks output (specific PR or commit for Github code)
2. Link to any deploy links relevant to the output (e.g. a URL for a website)
3. Specify a valid Dash address to receive the reward, or set to [NULL](#341-null-claims) to decline the reward.

Once your Claim has been created it will [processed](#435-processing-task-claims) by an admin.

> To create a Claim on Trello, leave a comment on the Bounty's [Trello Card](https://trello.com/b/FPJzDcok/dash-incubator-app) specifying the number and type of the Task you are claiming, along with the source links and your Dash address

### 3.4.1 Null Claims

In some cases, users wish to decline rewards for some reason.

This is strongly discouraged as incentives are how Incubator maintains a high level of creativity, productivity, and quality of output, and Claims themselves are how we track and account for work completion in the App.

However, to support the requirement, we introduced the option to create a Null Claim.

Therefore users who wish to decline rewards still need to make a Claim to signify and enable tracking of a Task's completion, but they can set the claim's Dash address to 'NULL' to signify that the actual reward is declined and therefore won't be awarded.

> To create a Null Claim in Trello, simply enter the term 'NULL' in place of a Dash address on the relevant [Claim comment](#42-claiming-tasks).

# 4 Admins

Admins are a second-tier of users in the Incubator who are incentivized to manage Bounties by earning a [commission](#27-rewards) on all Tasks completed within the Bounty.

All work (and spending) is structured as a Bounty within the Incubator, and Bounties can relate to working on the Incubator itself and be both managed and produced by Admins.

Admins are peers, each with control of a share of the Incubator's funds that they can use to create and manage bounties that incentivize Contributors to produce output for the Incubator.

Admins can simultaneously act as Contributors, by completing Tasks set by other Admins, but they cannot price or reserve Tasks for themselves.

> On Trello, the board is configured to only allow Admins to create and edit cards, including defining and assigning tasks to Board members. Any user can comment on cards to interact with Admins about the bounties they're managing.

## 4.1 Accepting Concepts

Bounties are created via the Acceptance of a user-submitted [Concept](#31-concepts) by an Admin.

 - A Bounty is only created from a Concept approval, and all Bounties must refer back to a single Concept
 - Any Admin can Accept a new Concept but must first validate that it meets our [Concept Acceptance Criteria](#411-concept-acceptance-criteria)
 - Admins do not need permission from or consensus between other Admins to accept a Concept
 - Admins can submit new Concepts themselves, but need another Admin to Accept them.
 - Once a Concept is Accepted, an implicit Claim for the Concept Task reward is considered to be approved automatically

> - In Trello, Admins formally Accept a Concept by [creating a new Bounty](#421-creating-bounties) for the Concept and linking it in a reply to the user's comment on the [New Concept Card](https://trello.com/c/6XAuy9DW/94-request-new-concept) card.
> - The Admin should also add an entry to the [Awarded Claims List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mhXlo4ylqWLLSYN4MGiLWlp7Gq3jrsDt0kB701dwMNU/edit#gid=0), using the user's details and Dash address from the Concept they submitted

### 4.1.1 Concept Acceptance Criteria

Admins must judge that Concepts they wish to Accept meet all of the following criteria:

1. Provide a clear Value Proposition that can return value to Dash that's inline with our [Strategy](#13-strategy) and [Dash Vision](#12-dash-vision)
2. Provide enough detail on requirements to enable a Bounty to achieve the stated goals
3. Be technically feasible using the current Dash Protocol or some unreleased but known iteration of it
4. Be unique within the existing set of Concepts & Bounties already added to the Incubator, i.e. not a duplicate or very similar scope to an existing active Bounty
5. Be achievable in terms of costs compared to the Incubator's current funding levels

## 4.2 Bounty Management

### 4.2.1 Creating Bounties

Bounties are created exclusively by Admins who [Accept](#435-processing-task-claims) a community-submitted Concept and consequently receive [Ownership](#422-bounty-ownership) of the Bounty.

Admins must ensure the following information is correctly configured on new Bounties that they create:

1. The creator of the Bounty is set as the [Owner](#422-bounty-ownership) Admin of the Bounty
2. The correct [Type](#22-bounty-types) for the Bounty is selected field (either Project, Specification, Job or Programme)
3. The Concept the Bounty was created from is linked in the Concept Doc field
4. The Description text reflects the Value Proposition of the related Concept.
5. The Concept creator is listed as a [Stakeholder](#25-bounty-stakeholders)
6. Optionally appoint a Secondary Admin for the Bounty

> In Trello, Bounty ownership is designated by assigning the Admin user as the Member of the card on the top left below the card title.  When two Admins are assigned to the card, the secondary Admin is designated by putting their Trello username into the Secondary Admin field on the card.

### 4.2.2 Bounty Ownership

The Admin who created a Bounty is given the rights as the Owner of that Bounty, also known as the Primary Admin of the Bounty.

The Bounty Owner has exclusive rights to edit the Bounty's fields, define Tasks and process resulting Claims, and change the Bounty's [Status](#23-bounty-status).

The Bounty Owner may transfer ownership to another Admin at any time.

> In Trello, Ownership is determined by the Admin who is a Member of the Card and who's username isn't specified in the Secondary Admin field.  

### 4.2.3 Secondary Admins

The Bounty Owner can optionally appoint a Secondary Admin (Secondary) to the Bounty, enabling a maximum of two Admins to manage a bounty at one time.

Secondaries cannot edit the Bounty's details but can create Tasks that they [own](#432-task-ownership) within the Bounty independently from the Bounty Owner's Tasks, and process Claims on those and receive their Admin Reward.

This enables multiple Admins to manage a single Bounty and complete Tasks provided that those Tasks are owned by another Admin on the Bounty.

The Bounty's Owner Admin can transfer the Secondary slot to a different Admin at any time, or remove the Secondary altogether without their agreement, however, the removed Secondary will still retain control of any Tasks they owned on the Bounty.  

Secondaries can leave a Bounty or transfer the secondary position to another Admin who agrees at any time.

> In Trello, Bounty Owners can appoint Secondaries on a Card by entering their name in the Secondary Admin field and assigning them as a Member of the Card. 

### 4.2.4 Forking Bounties

Apart from creating a new Bounty from a Concept, Admins have another option to fork a Bounty, by creating a new Bounty that shares the original Concept but is providing some significant modification, revision or alternative implementation to the Bounty that is being forked.

> In Trello, a fork can be created from a Bounty's Card by just making a new Card and linking the Concept that both Card's share in the Concept Doc custom field of the card.  

## 4.3 Task Management

### 4.3.1 Creating Tasks

Admins can create [Tasks](#25-tasks) on any Bounty that they're the current Owner or Secondary Admin of.

When creating a Task, the Admin sets the Description, which must provide enough information to allow a Contributor to complete the work, either in the description itself or by linking a Specification.

The due-date is the date whereby if a [Claim](#26-claims) is not made for the Task, the Admin has the option to cancel the task or cancel any reservation at the Admin's discretion.

> When defining a Task in Trello, the Admin will chose the correct Checklist for the task type, and specify the following information:
>1. A Task number, which is the sequential number of the Task in the relevant Checklist
>2. A Description, summarising the broad requirements by a short definition is needed, and a link to a Specification to provide further detail if needed.
>3. An amount of Dash for the Reward.  This can be [negotiated](#433-pricing-tasks) between the Admin and prospective users
>4. The name of the Admin who created the Task (i.e. the [Task Owner](#432-task-ownership))
>5. When reserving a Task for a user, specify the due-date and assign the Trello user as the member on the Task
>
> This information should be entered into the Task description in the following format:
>
>```[taskNumber][taskDescription](AdminUsername)([amount] DASH)```

### 4.3.2 Task Ownership

When either the Primary or Secondary Admin defines a [Task](#25-tasks) they become the Owner of that Task.

A Task owner has exclusive rights to:

- Edit or complete the Task 
- Process Claims on those Tasks and therefore receive the Admin reward on any awarded Claims.  
- Transfer Ownership of the Task to another Admin
- Optionally, the Admin can set Task ownership to 'Open', meaning the other Admin on the bounty is free to process the Claim and receive the commission reward

If an Admin leaves a Bounty, for example via Owner transfer or removal of a secondary, the leaving Admin retains ownership of their own Tasks after they left, until they are completed or they decide to transfer their ownership to another Admin.

If a Task has an unprocessed Claim for more than 5 days with no response to the user from the Admin, the other Admin on the Bounty can take ownership of the Task to process the Claim and receive the commission reward.

> On Trello, Admin ownership is designated by the name of the Admin user in the Task description.
> Secondly, any Task without an Admin username in the description is considered to be 'open', meaning the other Admin on the card can process it and receive the reward.

### 4.3.3 Pricing Tasks

Pricing Tasks in the Incubator takes a different and more flexible approach to traditional methods of sourcing as it factors in externalities such as priority, time constraints, skills availability (or overheads due to sourcing additional resources) and productivity incentives, whilst factoring out notions that ignore these factors such as fixed hourly-rates, market-rates or salary-based arrangements that won't necessarily achieve our goals at the speed we want or with the level of productivity we want to achieve for the value we want to deliver.

For example, if Tasks are urgent or highly specialized and resources are not available, or Tasks have existed for a long time without uptake, higher rewards can be set to achieve uptake on the Tasks, including the option to offer rewards for promoting those Tasks and/or placing the necessary resources, which can result in reward levels above traditional "market rates" to deliver the output we want in the time needed.

On the other hand, low priority tasks with multiple resources already on-boarded and available who could under-bid each other and without time-constraints can often provide output well below "market rates".

In other words, Tasks should be priced via a process to discover what is the minimum reward level needed to incentivize a Contributor to deliver something and deciding whether externalities such as needing to find & onboard the necessary resources or meet a certain deadline need to be factored in based on the Bounty's priority.

Fiat prices should be taken into consideration when a Task is created, but Tasks shouldn't be repriced if the fiat value changes unless not doing so would prevent completion of the Task.

### 4.3.4 Reserving Tasks

Except for [Job](#22-bounty-types) Bounty types, Admins must reserve Tasks to a specific user for the Task to be considered Active.

Admins can arrange reservations and negotiate the Task's terms with the user within the comments or via private communication, but once the Task is reserved to the user, the terms are considered agreed and are public information.

> On Trello, Tasks are represented by Checklists on the Bounty's Card, and are reserved by setting the Member setting to the user who reserved the Task and setting a date in the Due Date field.

### 4.3.5 Processing Task Claims

When a user completes a Task, they create a [Claim](#26-claims) that the [Task Owner](#432-task-ownership) Admin needs to process to decide if the Claim can be Approved, if QA is needed, or if there are issues that need to be resolved.

Approved Claims on Tasks go into the [Awarded Claims List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mhXlo4ylqWLLSYN4MGiLWlp7Gq3jrsDt0kB701dwMNU/edit#gid=0) from which the reward will be sent to the claimant.

If a Contributor wants to dispute a Claim decision, they can ask for a second opinion, in which case the other Admin on the Bounty, or any other Admin if the Bounty only has one Admin, can provide a second assessment.

Ultimately, decisions on whether some output meets the requirements specified in the Task definition are the sole discretion of the Admin who owns the Task.

> In Trello, Admins can Approve a Claim by ticking the Task's Checkbox and leaving a comment on the Bounty card as follows:
>
>```Claim Approved: [@username][checklistName]([taskIds])([amount] Dash)```
>
>For example:
>
>```Claim Approved: @somedev Production Tasks (1,2) (1 Dash)```
>
>Admins must then enter the details into the [Awarded Claims List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mhXlo4ylqWLLSYN4MGiLWlp7Gq3jrsDt0kB701dwMNU/edit#gid=0), filling in all columns and double checking the userâ€™s payment address and reward amount, to enable the claim to be awarded.

## 4.4 Admin Rewards

Admins are incentivized via a baseline reward as a % commission on all Claims that they award on Bounty Tasks that they own, using the rates defined in the [Price List](#27-rewards), plus additional [commision bonuses](#441-commission-bonuses) for the most active Admins.

Admins can earn additional rewards by completing Bounty Tasks themselves, provided they are defined and approved by another Admin that is Primary or Secondary Admin on the Bounty, in other words, Admin's can't set and price their own work, but they can set and manage work for each other if needed.

Admin rewards for commission on tasks don't require formal claims, they are issued automatically to a Bounty Admin when the associated Tasks are awarded via the [Awarded Claims List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mhXlo4ylqWLLSYN4MGiLWlp7Gq3jrsDt0kB701dwMNU/edit#gid=0).

Note that Admins can also opt to decline rewards by creating a [Null Claim](#341-null-claims) on their commision within a Task Claim.

> To set a Null Claim on their Commission Reward, an Admin should enter their Dash address as 'NULL' in the Claim in the [Awarded Claims List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mhXlo4ylqWLLSYN4MGiLWlp7Gq3jrsDt0kB701dwMNU/edit#gid=0)

### 4.4.1 Commission Bonuses

Each individual Admin's commission is variable based on the number of [Task Claims](#26-claims) they Approved in the previous 30 days (including "today"). The commissions that Admins can earn are tiered as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong># of Claims Approved</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Commission Rate</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0 - 14
    </td>
    <td>10%
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>15 - 29
    </td>
    <td>12%
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>30 +
    </td>
    <td>15%
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>  

Each Commission Bonus is based on the Tier that the Adminâ€™s previous 30 days contributions fall into. The "next" tier of commission is effective immediately once an Admin crosses the threshold, and is effective for all claims as long as the Admin stays within the Tier.

For example:

- Admin Alice has processed 10 claims in the past 30 days (including today). If Alice processes 5 additional claims today, Alice will be eligible for a 12% commission on the 5th claim (and any additional claims).
- Admin Bob has processed 34 claims in the past 30 days, but 7 of those were processed exactly 30 days ago. If Bob processes claims today, each of those will earn 15%. If Bob does not process at least 2 claims today, his commission rate will be 12% for claims processed tomorrow until his 30 day count is 30 or more again, at which point Bob will return to a 15% commission.
- Admin Carol has processed 9 claims in the past 30 days. Today Carol processes 21 claims. For the first 5 claims Carol processes today the commission is 10%. For the next 15 (claims 15 - 29) the commissions is 12%. The final claim Carol processes has a 15% commission.

## 4.5 Governance

The Governance Committee is responsible for Governance of the Incubator which is implemented via appointing or removing Admins, or updating these Rules.

Governance Committee Quorum is required in both cases, which means that > 50% of voters agree to Admin and Governance Committee appointments / removals or changes to the Rules etc. Governanace Committee members reserve the option to recuse themselves from voting by not registering a vote (within an agreed voting period) or selecting/commenting â€˜Recuseâ€™ against the vote itself.

# 5 Funds

## 5.1 Proposals

The App is funded from a series of [Proposals](#64-proposals) submitted to the [Dash Network](https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/governance/understanding.html) on a quarterly basis, with all spending of those funds commissioned and tracked via Tasks owned by Admins within the Bounty System itself and settled via transactions on the Dash blockchain that anyone can verify.

The amount requested might vary to target the general scale and buffer that the Governance Committee feel the Incubator should aim to spend, but not to deliver specific projects or milestones as there is no centralized planning to do so in the Incubator.

When certain projects arise that do require specific additional funding, individual proposals should be raised detailing the value proposition and estimated costs of those projects individually.

## 5.2 Budgets

All funds will be received to the published [Incubator Wallet](#63-accounting) address(s) and will be pooled across proposals as a single rolling-budget available to Admins to allocate to Bounties.

The funds the Governance Committee requests from the Dash Network are purely to increase the Incubator Wallet and increase the overall budget available to Admins to spend.

Incubator is a pure-Dash fund meaning that rewards are denominated only in Dash.  Therefore any fluctuations in the fiat price of Dash will only reflect the pricing of new [Tasks](#25-tasks) by Admins and prior agreements made in Dash are not necessarily renegotiated or adjusted.

## 5.3 Governance Committee

The Governance Committee are the [Admins](#4-admins) who create [Proposals](#64-proposals) to the Dash Network for and on behalf of the Incubator, Govern the Incubator by voting and handle (but aren't liable for) custody and transactions of the Dash received on behalf of Admins.

The Governance Committee agree to use funds solely for the purposes of awarding [Task Claims](#26-claims) that were approved by Admins and are inline with the Rules in this document.

Governance Committee roles are intended to be temporary roles until the Incubator can be implemented as a fully decentralized dApp in future, with Proposal Dash awarded to a Contract on Dash Platform and distributed autonomously using code.

Before the full dApp implementation, and before fully decentralized mechanisms are innovated to ensure that all users are adhering to these Rules and operations of the App are as efficient as possible, the Governance Committee are currently granted some additional rights equivalent to 'super-users' within the App as follows:

 - Appoint or transfer Primary or Secondary Admin positions on a Bounty
 - Pause/Unpause a Bounty or some of the Tasks
 - Appoint or remove Admins from the Incubator
 - Create Tasks on bounties when Primary/Secondary aren't available
 - Mediate updates to these Rules
 - Any other actions to enforce adherence to these rules

 If the Governance Committee need to exercise any of these rights, they must leave a comment (e.g. on Trello or Github depending on the action) detailing the action and explaining the reasons as to why an action was taken.

Governance Committee members can be added & removed through voting as per the voting criteria defined in Section 4.5 - Governance. If a Governance Committee member is removed, any held responsibilities/funds will be transferred to another Governance Committee member. 

> Governance Committee roles are incentivized by [Service Bounties] defined within the Incubator app itself.

## 5.4 Auditing

As an [Open-source DFO](#14-full-transparency), anyone can perform a full public audit of the Incubator at any time, to check that all work is being conducted as per these Rules, and verify the rewards issued to individual Incubator users for that work via the Dash blockchain.

Below we provide guidelines on how to audit the Incubator from a financial and work perspective, but people can devise their own audit strategies as they deem fit.

### 5.4.1 Auditing Accounts

Every Dash of funding spent by the Incubator must be accounted for via a [Task Claim](#26-claims) approved by an [Admin](#4-admins) with an associated transaction on the Dash blockchain.

Therefore we can verify that the total funds spent listed on the [Dash Blockchain](https://insight.dash.org/insight/address/XbFb9b1qaoLykngDbUwBVBFwSHuwQRhSqc) tally to total task claims awarded in the [Awarded Claims List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mhXlo4ylqWLLSYN4MGiLWlp7Gq3jrsDt0kB701dwMNU/edit#gid=0) to ensure that funds aren't being spent from the wallet arbitrarily by validating that:

 - Total funds spent via the Blockchain is equal to the total Dash sent minus the total Dash received from the [Incubator Wallet](#63-accounting).
 - Total funds spent on awarded Task Claims is equal to the total Dash spent in columns H (Reward) and N (Admin reward) in the [Awarded Claims List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mhXlo4ylqWLLSYN4MGiLWlp7Gq3jrsDt0kB701dwMNU/edit#gid=0).

Note that each Task lists the transaction id, which can also be parsed individually to verify the total amount.

### 5.4.2 Auditing Work

All work must be conducted inline with the Rules in this document and in the public domain.  Therefore anyone can audit how well the work being conducted in the Incubator is adhering to these rules at any time.

As a guideline, the following aspects of work are key areas to ensure the Rules are being implemented effectively.

 - Admins are pricing work fairly
 - Admins are interpreting the rules effectively
 - Concepts being approved are inline with the [Strategy](#13-strategy)
 - Quality of output is sufficient for rewards
 - Task deadlines and due dates are being managed effectively
